# New-York-Payroll-Analysis
Final Project Deliverable for Ironhack Data Analytics Bootcamp. Explores payroll data provided by the City of New York. 

## Project Description
The purpose of this project was to use NYC Payroll data to analyze which city agencies were reporting and accruing the most overtime, and to make suggestions about changes that can be made. Skills I demonstrate in this project include gathering data, cleaning it using Python, analyzing the data in Python and MySql (both individually as well as together, more on that later), and building visualizations using Tableau. The project also required the use of softer skills such as time-management, problem solving, work-prioritization, and gathering and presenting valuable insight. 

## Data
[NYC Citywide Payroll Data][1] - Because New York City is an open-data city, they publish data regarding city operations for anyone to access and take advantage of. This annually updata dataset lists all city employees, their starting dates, position titles, salaries, employing agencies, hours, and working locations since 2014. It also reports regular and overtime hours and pay. More can be read on it by accessing the link. 

[City and Town Population Totals: 2020-2023][2] - This U.S. Census data lists the populations of all cities and towns in the United States (with a population of more that 20,000) for 2020-2023. This dataset was only used in Tableau, as it was relevant to my visualization building, but not to my analysis.
